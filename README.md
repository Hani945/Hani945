## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Hanna!

I'm an aspiring Front End Developer currently learning through the ALX Software Engineering Program. With a passion for clean, responsive design and a growing skill set in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I'm on a mission to build user-friendly web experiences â€” one project at a time.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on learning Front End Development and building beginner-friendly web projects.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and how to create responsive, accessible web interfaces.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on simple, creative web projects that help me grow and support others learning to code.

ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with JavaScript logic, structuring real-world projects, and getting started with open source.

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my learning journey, ALX program experience, or how I stay motivated as a beginner in tech.

ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: She/Her 

âš¡ Fun fact: I once studied medicine, and now Iâ€™m learning to code â€” proving itâ€™s never too late to start something new.
